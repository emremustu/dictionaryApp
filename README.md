# dictionaryApp
An online dictionary API project that i found at youtube. I found some problems at the original version.
1- It was not running when press enter
2- The sound was not changing when word changes
You can find the video here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUkgK7TI0x0&list=PLNCevxogE3fiLT6bEObGeVfHVLnttptKv&index=2&t=1322s
